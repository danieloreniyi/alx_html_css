# CSS Advanced Project

This project is a continuation of the **HTML Advanced** project.  
Here, the focus is on styling the page with **CSS** and making sure the layout matches the design provided on Figma.  

The main goal is to practice writing clean, semantic HTML and well-structured CSS while bringing the design to life.
